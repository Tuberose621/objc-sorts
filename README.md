## objc-sorts

A collection of [sorting algorithms](http://xkcd.com/1185/) implemented in Objective-C.

0. Download, clone, or fork
1. Open and run the Xcode project
2. Each sorting algorithm is executed on a list of 10,000 randomly generated numbers
3. Each sorted list is verified
4. Execution time for each algorithm is logged
5. You can find sweet sorting animations [here](http://www.sorting-algorithms.com)

## Algorithms

* [Quick Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
* [Merge Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
* [Insertion Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
* [Selection Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)
* [Bubble Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
* *More coming soon!*

## Why?

0. Sorting is an important problem
1. Programming is [fun](http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/38499495.jpg)
2. Programmers need [practice](http://xkcd.com/844/)
3. Objective-C is awesome, but most sorts that you'll find on the interwebs are written in C/C++, Java, or Python
4. This is a good reference for all programmers
5. Having these algorithms explicitly implemented in one location is convenient
