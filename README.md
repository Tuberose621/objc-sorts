# objc-sorts

A collection of [sorting algorithms](http://xkcd.com/1185/) implemented in Objective-C.

## Sorts

* [Selection Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)
* [Merge Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
* [Quick Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
* *More coming soon!*

### Why does this project exist?

1. Programming is fun

2. Programmers need practice

3. Objective-C is awesome, but most sorting implementations that you'll find on the interwebs are written in C/C++, Java, or Python.

4. This is a good reference for programmers of all levels (or, it will be once more sorts are added!)

5. It's a convenient way to have all these sorts in one place
