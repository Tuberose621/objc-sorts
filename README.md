# objc-sorts

A collection of [sorting algorithms](http://xkcd.com/1185/) implemented in Objective-C.

You can find cool sorting animations [here](http://www.sorting-algorithms.com).

1. Open and run the Xcode project. 
2. Each sorting algorithm is executed on a list of 10,000 randomly generated numbers
3. Each sorted list is verified
4. Execution time for each algorithm is logged

## Sorts

* [Selection Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)
* [Merge Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
* [Quick Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
* *More coming soon!*

### Why does this project exist?

1. Programming is [fun](http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/38499495.jpg)

2. Programmers need [practice](http://xkcd.com/844/)

3. Objective-C is awesome, but most sorting implementations that you'll find on the interwebs are written in C/C++, Java, or Python.

4. This is can be a good reference for programmers of all levels

5. Having these algorithms explicitly implemented in one location is convenient
